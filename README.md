# Reinforcement Learning Strategies

Reinforcement learning is a class of machine learning (ML), where the agent learn by interacting with it environement allowing it to improve over time.

This repository contain different implementation of reinforcement learning methods on the `"FrozenLake-v1"` game from the Python library **Gymnasium**.  
Here is a list of all the implemented methods:

## Model-Based
- Dynamic Programming (Policy Iteration)  
- Dynamic Programming (Value Iteration)  

## Model-Free
- Monte Carlo (First-Visit)  
- Monte Carlo (Every-Visit)  
- SARSA (On-Policy TD)  
- Q-Learning (Off-Policy TD)  

## Deep Reinforcement Learning
- Deep Q-Network (DQN)  
- Double DQN  
- Dueling DQN
